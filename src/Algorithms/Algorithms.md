# ArrayList Algorithms

Common ArrayList algorithms that utilize traversals include operations to:

- Determine a minimum or maximum value
- Compute a sum or average 
- Determine if at least one element has a particular property
- Determine if all elements have a particular property
- Determine the number of elements having a particular property
- Access all consecutive pairs of elements
- Determine the presence or absence of duplicate elements
- Shift or rotate elements left or right
- Reverse the order of the elements
- Insert elements
- Delete elements

## Advanced Operations

Some algorithms require multiple String, array, or ArrayList objects to be traversed simultaneously.
