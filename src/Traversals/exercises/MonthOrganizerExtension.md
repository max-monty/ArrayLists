### ArrayList Traversal Practice

Building on the MonthOrganizer activity, let's practice traversing ArrayLists in different ways.

After creating the ArrayList of months in chronological order, complete the following tasks (do this in the same class as before):

1. Print all months in reverse order (December to January)
2. Find and print all months that start with the letter 'J'
3. Count and print how many months have more than 5 letters
